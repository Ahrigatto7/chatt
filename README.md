This repository contains examples and utilities including a Saju (사주) analysis
web app located in `saju_platform/`.

The app allows birth information input, calculates the four pillars and simple
interpretations, and stores results to a JSON file so previous analyses can be
reviewed. Interpretation text is generated by a small rule-based module that can
be expanded with additional heuristics.
Refer to the directory README for details.
